# Ideology and Violence: Mapping State Politics and Mass Shootings in 2008 and 2016 

## Description

The goal of this project was to see if there was a relationship between a state's political ideology, meaning either a Democratic state or a Republican state, and mass shootings. Political ideology in this project separates how states and political parties treat gun laws. Meaning that Democratic states would have stricter gun laws, and Republican states would not have strict gun laws. This helps to answer my hypothesis that Republican states, due to their less restrictive gun laws, would have more mass shootings than Democratic states. Using the shootings.csv file attached, 2008 and 2016 were two years chosen to see if there was any change in mass shootings. Two maps helped me visualize the results better and see if my hypothesis was correct.
